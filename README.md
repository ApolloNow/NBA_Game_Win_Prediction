** Following is the implementation of a combined web scraping and machine learning project to predict Nba games using Basketball reference data - https://www.basketball-reference.com/

The first phase of the project involves scraping the Basketball reference website for basic and advanced stats for all previous played games all the way back from 2016.
We take all the regualr season and playoff games and take the box score from within those games to use as predictors for our Machine Learning model.

The second phase involves the ML implementation using that data.

I have always been a huge basketball fan and was always interested in utilising all the advanced in game stats from these nba games to build various projects.
This has been my stepping stone towards learning the fundamentals of web scraping and implementing an end-to-end ML model.

I will soon be implementing more such projects - Hoping to put my newfound skills of web scraping to work.
